    "Some Coomon use cases of Elastic Net Regeression are as follows:\n",
    "1. Dealing with Lots of Features: Elastic Net Regression is helpful when you have datasets with many different factors or features that could potentially affect the outcome you're trying to predict. It can automatically identify and select the most important features, making it suitable for tasks like analyzing gene expression, processing images, or understanding text data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Handling Correlated Factors: If some of the factors in your dataset are strongly related to each other, Elastic Net Regression can handle this situation well. It reduces the impact of correlated factors and ensures that the model considers each factor's contribution separately. This is useful in scenarios like economic modeling, social science research, or financial analysis, where variables might be interrelated.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Making Predictions: Elastic Net Regression is commonly used for making predictions based on a set of input factors. For example, you can predict stock prices, patient outcomes in healthcare, customer behavior in marketing, or environmental variables in environmental sciences. It helps to find the best combination of factors that influence the outcome you want to predict.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Selecting Important Features: Elastic Net Regression is great for identifying the most relevant factors in your dataset. It automatically selects the important features that have a significant impact on the outcome, allowing you to focus on the most informative factors and simplify your model. This is beneficial in various fields, such as identifying important economic indicators, understanding key drivers of social phenomena, or finding critical variables in scientific research.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Regularized Regression: Elastic Net Regression is an excellent choice when you want to prevent overfitting and improve the generalization of your model. It strikes a balance between simplicity and accuracy by combining two types of regularization techniques. This makes it useful for regression analysis in areas like economics, engineering, social sciences, and natural sciences.\n"

However, this approach may lead to a loss of information if the missing values are substantial.\n",
